Prompt Pad is a tool for drafting prompts for coding AIs like Jules, Bolt, or Claude Code. It's just a simple text editor with autosave. Its purpose is to make it easier to work on a lengthier prompt without worrying about losing your progress if you get interrupted and switch away for a bit.

## "Code Cards" Lucid extension (WIP)

Prompt Pad also includes a Lucid editor extension called "Code Cards" that allows you to visually organize your prompts as cards on your Lucid document canvas.

> [!WARNING]
> The "Code Cards" extension is not an official Lucid feature. It is a custom extension built as an indie dev project, and is not affiliated with or endorsed by Lucid.
